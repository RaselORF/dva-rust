# dva-rust

A Damn Vulnerable Application (DVA) that show cases the bugs caught by various fixers of Rust. 

The application contains isolated files each showcasing a program that has a bug caught by iCR. 

## Stats

The total number of files:

The total number of bugs found:

## Flavors that are represented multiple times
For each iCR flavor, there should be at least one example. We should try to avoid having more than one example. However, if there are some flavors that are represented more than once, we list them here.

## Flavors that are not represented
For various reasons, we may not be able to include a flavor as an example. Some bugs only deonstrate themselves in real programs and are hard to capture in a test. We should list these flavors here.
